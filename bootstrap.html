      <h3> overview</h3>
      <p>Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
 However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease,
 diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die 
at any age.</p>

<p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads.
 Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an
 alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.</p>

      <h3>Prevention 2</h3>
      <p>To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: 

Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.
Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.
Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.
Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.</p>

  <h1> Etymology</h1>
</div>
<p>The pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred in news media as the "coronavirus 
pandemic",[9] despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and 
outbreaks (e.g. SARS).[10]

During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus",
 "Wuhan coronavirus",[11] "the coronavirus outbreak" and the "Wuhan coronavirus outbreak"[12] with 
the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[13][14] In January 2020, the WHO recommended 
2019-nCoV[15] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[16] as interim names for the virus and
 disease per 2015 international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), 
animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.
[17] WHO finalized the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020.[18] 
Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the
 outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[19] WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 
virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[18]

WHO names variants of concern and variants of interest using Greek letters. The initial practice of
 naming them according to where the variants were identified (e.g. Delta began as the "Indian variant")
 is no longer common.[20] A more systematic naming scheme reflects the variant's PANGO lineage
 (e.g., Omicron's lineage is B.1.1.529) and is used for other variants.</p>

<h3> CASES </h3>
<p>Official "case" counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose
 test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols whether or not they experienced 
symptomatic disease.[46][47] Due to the effect of sampling bias, studies which obtain a more accurate 
number by extrapolating from a random sample have consistently found that total infections 
considerably exceed the reported case counts.[48][49] Many countries, early on, had official policies
 to not test those with only mild symptoms.[50][51] The strongest risk factors for severe illness are
 obesity, complications of diabetes, anxiety disorders, and the total number of conditions.[52]

In early 2020, a meta-analysis of self-reported cases in China by age indicated that a relatively 
low proportion of cases occurred in individuals under 20.[53] It was not clear whether this was
 because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop symptoms and be 
tested.[54] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely 
to be infected.[55]

Among more thorough studies, preliminary results from 9 April 2020 found that in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, 15 percent of a population sample tested positive for antibodies.[56] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, found rates of positive antibody tests that indicated more infections than reported.[57][58] Seroprevalence-based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.[59]

Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[60] but a subsequent analysis claimed that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[61]

In December 2021, the number of cases continued to climb due to several factors including new COVID-19
 variants. As of that 28 December, 282,790,822 individuals worldwide had been confirmed as infected.
[62] As of 14 April 2022, over 500 million cases were confirmed globally.[63] Most cases are
 unconfirmed with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimating the true number of 
cases as of early 2022 to be in the billions.[64][65]</p>

11.77 billion doses have been administered globally, and 5.85 million are now administered

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has declared the novel coronavirus
 (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic (1). At a news briefing , WHO Director-General, 
Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted that over the past 2 weeks, the number of cases outside China
 increased 13-fold and the number of countries with cases increased threefold. Further increases 
are expected. He said that the WHO is "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread.</p>
