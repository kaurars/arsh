<h3 style= "font-size:50px;" "font-family:cursive;">COVID-19 Data from Selected Hospitals</h3>
<p>>>The National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS) collects data on patient care in hospital-based settings
 to describe patterns of health care delivery and utilization in the United States. Settings 
currently include inpatient and emergency departments (ED). Additionally, the NHCS contributes 
data that may inform public health emergencies as the survey is designed to capture emerging
 diseases and viruses that require hospitalizations, including COVID-19 encounters. The 2020 and 2021 
NHCS are not yet fully operational so it is important to note that these data are not nationally 
representative.</p>

<p>>>The data are from 45 hospitals submitting inpatient and 44 hospitals submitting ED Uniform Bill 
(UB)-04 administrative claims from March 18, 2020â€“December 28, 2021.  Even though the data are not
 nationally representative, they can provide insight on the impact of COVID-19 on various types of
 hospitals throughout the country. This information is not available in other hospital reporting 
systems. The NHCS data from these hospitals can show results by a combination of indicators related 
to COVID-19, such as length of inpatient stay, in-hospital mortality, comorbidities, and intubation
 or ventilator use. NHCS data allow for reporting on patient conditions and treatments within the
 hospital over time.</p>
