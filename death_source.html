<h style= "font-size: 50px;" "color: blue;">Case and death count data</h>
<p>From the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, WHO collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases
 and deaths through official communications under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005),
 complemented by monitoring the official ministries of health websites and social media accounts. 
Since 22 March 2020, global data are compiled through WHO region-specific dashboards (see links below)
, and/or aggregate count data reported to WHO headquarters daily.</p>

<p>Counts primarily reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based upon WHO case definitions;
 although some departures may exist due to local adaptations. Counts include both domestic and 
repatriated cases. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times
 (e.g. time to case notification, and time to reporting of deaths) differ between countries, 
territories and areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with variable
 under or overestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data
 at a global level.</p>

<p>All data represent date of reporting as opposed to date of symptom onset. All data are subject to
 continuous verification and may change based on retrospective updates to accurately reflect trends,
 changes in country case definitions and/or reporting practices. Significant data errors detected or
 reported to WHO may be corrected at more frequent intervals.</p>

<p>New case and death counts: Counts of new cases and deaths are calculated by subtracting previous
 cumulative total counts from the current count. These counts are updated incrementally throughout
 the day as more information becomes available. Daily new case and death counts are complete by
 23:59 CET/CEST each day. Due to differences in reporting methods, cut-off times, retrospective data
 consolidation and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always reflect daily totals
 published by individual countries, territories or areas. Due to the recent trend of countries
 conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their
 total counts, such data may reflect as negative numbers in the new cases / new deaths counts as

 appropriate. This will aid users in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details
 become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, data will
 be updated accordingly.</p>

<p>Current day counts, global epidemic curves and trends: Due to the incremental updates to the
 dashboard, global case and death counts visualised for the current day may reflect partial data
 until counts have been fully updated for all regions that day. This must be taken into consideration
 when interpreting global epidemic curves and trends.<p>

<p>Time stamps and updates: Time/date stamps reflect when the data was last updated by WHO. Due to the 
time required to process and validate the incoming data, there is a delay between reporting to WHO 
and the update of the dashboard. To account for different time zones across WHO Regions and data
 transmission methods, and improve the timeliness of data availability, updates to the global 
dashboard are applied three times per day.</p>

<p>Counts and corrections made after these times will be carried forward to the next reporting cycle 
for that specific region. Delayed reporting for any specific country, territory or area may result 
in pooled counts for multiple days being presented, with a retrospective update to counts on previous
 days to accurately reflect trends. Significant data errors detected or reported to WHO may be
 corrected at more frequent intervals.</p>

<p>Other: cases and deaths reported from international conveyances, included in global totals but not
 reflected in epidemiological curves as not associated with a country or region.</p>

<h4>Rates: <0.001 per 100,000 population may be rounded to 0.</h4>

<h2 style= "font-size:30px;" "color: grey;">Vaccination data</h2>

<p>We aim to provide weekly updates on vaccine introduction and administration by countries, territories
 and areas. These data are pooled from numerous sources, including direct reports from Member States,
 WHO review of publicly available official data, or data collated and published by third-party sites
 such as Our World in Data. Data published by third-party sites have not been validated by WHO, and
 WHO cannot comment on accuracy or completeness. Differences in counts are expected compared to other
 sources due to different inclusion criteria and data cut-off times.</p>

<p>Total administered doses, people vaccinated with at least one dose, and people fully vaccinated are
 cumulative totals since the start of vaccination in the respective country, through the latest data
 update. Total administered doses refers to single doses, and may not equal the total number of people
 vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (individuals receive multiple doses). Total doses
 administered per 100 population may exceed 100, for example when over half of the population receives
 both required vaccine doses under a two dose regime. Rates <0.001 per 100 population may be rounded 
to 0. Where multiple vaccines are used in a country/territory/area, the start date displayed is
 equivalent to start date of the first vaccine introduced. Suspensions (temporary or otherwise) of 
vaccination rollout are not taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers' vaccine products does not imply that
 they are endorsed or recommended by the WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not
 mentioned. Apart from limited exceptions, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by
 initial capital letters.</p>

<h3 style= "font-size: 30px;" "color: blue;">Public Health and Social Measures data</h3>

<p>Public health and social measures (PHSM) are actions taken by individuals, institutions, communities,
 local and national governments, and international bodies, to suppress or stop the spread of a disease.
 In response to COVID-19, countries are implementing a package of measures, calibrated to the local
 context and epidemiology of the disease. These include individual, environmental, social and physical
 distancing, surveillance and response, movement and travel measures. For more information, WHO has
 produced the following overview of public health and social measures in the context of COVID-19.</p>

<h3 style= "font-size: 30px;" "color: blue;">Methods</h3>

<p>This dashboard displays longitudinal measures of PHSM severity and timing by country, territory or 
area against 7-day rolling average counts of confirmed cases and deaths reported, based on 
methodology developed by the WHO Regional Office for Europe. Six types of PHSM are scored as
 indicators calculated from an ordinal scale, corresponding with the response policy’s degree of
 intensity (see indicators below) and the scope. Scope considers whether the measure is implemented
 across the entire country, territory or area, or if applied on a sub-national level or group of
 people. The overall severity of the measure is reduced if it applies only to a select group or
 location as opposed to the whole country or general population. The average of these six indicators
 forms the composite PHSM Severity Index score. Individual measures and a summary measure 
(PHSM Severity Index) are assigned a colour shade based on the severity scores – darker shades
 represent more severe measures.</p>
