<h2 style= "color:blue;" "font-size:65px;" "font-family:cursive;"> Covid Dashboard By WHO </h>
<p style= "color:black;" "font-family:sans-serif;">The WHO coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard presents official daily counts of COVID-19 cases, 
deaths and vaccine utilisation reported by countries, territories and areas. Through this dashboard,
 we aim to provide a frequently updated data visualization, data dissemination and data exploration
 resource, while linking users to other useful and informative resources.

Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented, and differences between information
 products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different 
inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times are to be expected. While steps are taken to
 ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. All 
counts are subject to variations in case detection, definitions, laboratory testing, vaccination 
strategy, and reporting strategies. Other important considerations are highlighted under the 
respective Data Sources below.

The designations employed and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of
 any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or
 area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted
 and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full 
agreement.

[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations 
Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).

[2] A dispute exists between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
 Northern Ireland concerning sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas).

Data for Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba have been disaggregated and displayed at the subnational 
level.

Weekend updates: Starting 19 June 2021, daily counts of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths reported
 to WHO headquarters on Saturdays and Sundays will be updated on this dashboard on the following
 Monday. Furthermore, data from the Eastern Mediterranean Region are no long update on Fridays. 
Data will continue to be attributed to the day of initial reporting to avoid artificial spikes in
 case and death incidence. Given continued and increasing volatility in daily count data, we continue
 to encourage all users to prioritize weekly counts and long term trends (over several weeks) as a 
more reliable measure of COVID-19 epidemiological activity and trends within 
countries/territories/areas, and at regional and global levels. Saturday and Sunday daily case and
 death counts may continue to be accessed via WHO Regional Office dashboards until further notice
 (please see links under ‘Other Resources’ below).</p>
